# Behavior-Driven Debugging for Legacy COBOL Systems

---

## Overview

Strategy: extract human-readable BDD-style narratives from COBOL runtime behavior and using these as artifacts for validation, inspection, and AI-assisted debugging.

This approach centers on **storytelling and inspection** — generating structured, traceable scenarios that expose hidden bugs and inconsistencies to humans and LLMs alike.

The goal is to produce a stream of testable, explainable behavioral narratives from COBOL systems with minimal intrusion.

## Key Components

### 1. **Structured Telemetry**

Begin by instrumenting COBOL as outlined in the primary Regan strategy:

* Trace side-effect operations (`MOVE`, `ADD`, `READ`, etc.)
* Capture variable names, values, line numbers, PIC clauses, and flags (e.g., `ROUNDED`, `SIZE ERROR`)
* Enrich with semantic tags (e.g., `apply-interest`, `evaluate-loan`, `finalize-invoice`)

### 2. **Semantic Grouping**

Group telemetry entries into logical units of behavior:

* One group per paragraph, batch step, or business function
* Include input state, operation summary, and resulting state
* Aggregate relevant flags and control-flow decisions

### 3. **BDD Scenario Generation**

Emit output in a Gherkin-inspired BDD format:

```gherkin
Scenario: Apply interest to customer balance
  Given an account with a balance of 100.00
  And an interest rate of 5%
  When interest is applied
  Then the new balance should be 105.00
  And no rounding occurred
```

Each scenario is:

* Deterministic
* Traceable to source lines
* Fully reproducible

### 4. **LLM-Assisted Review**

Feed these narratives into LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) and prompt them to:

* Spot inconsistencies
* Predict likely errors
* Suggest missing conditions or unexpected state transitions

LLMs act as behavioral oracles, flagging results that deviate from expectation — even when the underlying COBOL logic is obscure.

## Use Cases

### ✅ Uncovering Hidden Bugs

A rounding discrepancy observed in a narrative may reveal a longstanding bug that would be invisible in logs.

### ✅ Motivating Refactors

Readable BDD output is accessible to non-technical stakeholders, enabling better visibility into legacy system behavior.

### ✅ Test Case Generation

Every BDD trace is a ready-to-run scenario for reimplementation or contract inference.

### ✅ Behavioral Diffs

Compare telemetry traces and resulting BDDs across time to detect regressions or semantic drift.

## Optional Enhancements

* **BDD Approval Testing**: Validate that regenerated BDDs from the new system match approved scenarios from the original.
* **Gherkin Trace Archiving**: Version-control narratives for audit and comparison.
* **Fuzzed Input Narratives**: Inject randomized data and analyze LLM responses to expose edge cases.

## Conclusion

While formal verification and symbolic modeling are powerful, BDD-style output offers an accessible, audit-friendly, and LLM-compatible view of COBOL behavior. By transforming low-level execution traces into readable, structured narratives, we enable debugging through storytelling — and invite both humans and machines to ask the same question:

> *"Does this make sense?"*

When it doesn’t — we have a bug.

This is not a rewrite. This is a **confession pipeline**.

Regan doesn’t just interpret COBOL.

**It makes it speak.**
